# Router for Express.JS Applications

**[the-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/the-router)** — a minimalist router for Express.JS applications, inspired by Ruby on Rails. Here’s how I made it.

Example of how routing might look in a simple application.

```js
// Root routes
root("index#home");

// Basic CRUD routes
get("/users", "users#index");
get("/users/:id", "users#show");
post("/users", "users#create");
post("/users/:id", "users#update");
post("/users/:id/destroy", "users#destroy");

// Posts routes with scope
scope("blog", () => {
  get("/posts", "posts#index");
  get("/posts/:id", "posts#show");
  post("/posts", "posts#create");
  post("/posts/:id", "posts#update");
  post("/posts/:id/destroy", "posts#destroy");
});
```

## Context

I hadn’t written NodeJS applications for about 10 years. Curious about Telegram Mini Apps, I decided to build a few simple projects to explore this new field.

For this, I needed routing for the backend of my applications. Existing solutions didn’t quite impress me, so I decided to create my own router — simple, effective, and inspired by Ruby on Rails. It was also a great opportunity to refresh my knowledge of creating NPM packages, something I hadn’t done in 9 years.

## Design

### Expectations for the Router:

1. **Routing is defined in a separate file**

   This simplifies the application structure and avoids cluttering the main application file.

```js
import {
  root,
  get,
  post,
  routeScope as scope,
  getRouter,
} from "the-router";

// Root routes
root("index#home");

// Basic CRUD routes
get("/users", "users#index");
get("/users/:id", "users#show");
post("/users", "users#create");
post("/users/:id", "users#update");
post("/users/:id/destroy", "users#destroy");

// Posts routes with scope
scope("blog", () => {
  get("/posts", "posts#index");
  get("/posts/:id", "posts#show");
  post("/posts", "posts#create");
  post("/posts/:id", "posts#update");
  post("/posts/:id/destroy", "posts#destroy");
});

export default getRouter;
```

2. **The router integrates into the main ExpressJS file**

   A simple and effective entry point for the application: `src/index.js` or `src/main.js`.

```js
import express from "express";
import getRouter from "./routes"; // <<< DEFINE ROUTES

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(getRouter()); // <<< USER ROUTES

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Demo app is running on http://localhost:3000");
});
```

3. **Following conventions for connecting controllers**

Controllers are located in the `src/controllers` directory.

```bash
MyApp
└── src
    ├── controllers
    │   ├── blog
    │   │   └── postsController.ts
    │   ├── indexController.ts
    │   └── usersController.ts
    ├── index.ts
    └── routes
        └── index.ts
```

### File Structure

- Routes are defined in `src/routes/index.js`.
- Controllers contain the logic for handling requests:

Example: `src/controllers/usersController.ts` (or `.js`).

```ts
import { Request, Response } from "express";

export const index = (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send("List of all users");
};

export const show = (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  res.send(`Showing details for user ${id}`);
};

export const create = (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const userData = req.body;
  res.send(`Creating new user with data: ${JSON.stringify(userData)}`);
};

export const update = (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const userData = req.body;
  res.send(`Updating user ${id} with data: ${JSON.stringify(userData)}`);
};

export const destroy = (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  res.send(`Deleting user ${id}`);
};
```

## Implementation

### Steps:

1. Create a development container using **Docker**.
2. Set up **ESBuild** for compiling TypeScript to JavaScript.
3. Install **Jest** for testing.
4. Write tests to validate the first version of the router.
5. Implement the router until all tests pass.
6. Recover my long-unused NPM credentials (after 9 years).
7. Publish the NPM package as version `1.0.0`.
8. Fix critical installation bugs and remove versions `1.0.0` and `1.1.0`.
9. Apply the router to a production project with a dozen routes.

### Q&A

#### Why even do this? There are so many existing solutions!

- It’s **interesting**, **useful**, and contributes to diversity in solutions.

#### Why so simple? Shouldn’t it be more complex?

- Following the **KISS** principle. Complexity can be added later as needed.

#### Why controllers? Aren’t they unnecessary?

- Controllers are convenient for small projects. Higher abstractions like Action/Operation-like solutions are better suited for larger systems.

#### Is this solution even functional?

- Absolutely! The router was used in a small production app and performed perfectly with dozens of routes.

#### What size projects can it handle?

- **`the-router`** is suitable for applications with dozens of routes. There are no strict size limitations.
